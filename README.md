# MoneyChanger
This is a simple currency exchange utilitary program made in Python using [custom tkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter). <br>
Feel free to give feedback or suggestions.

# How to run
The GUI version requires you to have the libraries `request` and `customtkinter` installed. To install using pip, run: <br>
`pip install requests customtkinter`
You of course need to have python3 installed.

# TODO
- [o] Do a .exe functional for everyone
