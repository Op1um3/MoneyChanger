# MoneyChanger
This is a simple currency exchange utilitary program made in Python using [custom tkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter).
Feel free to give feedback or suggestions.

# How to run
The GUI version requires you to have the libraries `request` and `customtkinter` installed. To install using pip, run:
`pip install requests customtkinter`
You of course need to have python3 installed.

# TODO
- [x] Refactor the code
- [x] Write a proper readme file
- [ ] Use a proper API key
- [ ] Write docstring for the `convert` function
- [ ] Modify the `delete_labels` function to reuse it for error label handling
